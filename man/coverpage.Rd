\description{

\details{
coverpage function will create a cover page for the front of the workbook.
If a cover page is not wanted, do not run the coverpage function.
The only compulsory parameter is title.
All other parameters are optional and preset, only populate if they are wanted.
intro: Introductory information / about: About these data / dop: Date of publication.
source: Data source(s) used / blank: Information about why some cells are blank, if necessary.
relatedlink and relatedtext - any publications associated with the data (relatedlink is the 
actual hyperlink, relatedtext is the text you want to appear to the user).
names: Contact name / email: Contact email / phone: Contact telephone.
reuse: Set to "Yes" if you want the information displayed about the reuse of the data (will 
automatically be populated).
govdept: Default is "ONS" but if want reuse information without reference to ONS change govdept.
extrafields: Any additional fields that the user wants present on the cover page.
extrafieldsb: The text to go in any additional fields. Only one row per field. extrafields and 
extrafields must be vectors of the same length.
additlinks: Any additional hyperlinks the user wants.
addittext: The text to appear over any additional hyperlinks. additlinks and addittext must be 
vectors of the same length.
order: If the user wants the cover page to be ordered in a specific way, list the fields in a 
vector with each field name in speech marks.
e.g., order = c("intro", "about", relatedlink", "names", "phone", "email", "extrafields").
Change gridlines to "No" if gridlines are not wanted.
Column width automatically set unless user specifies a value in colwid_spec.
intro, about, source, dop, blank, names, phone can be set to hyperlinks - 
e.g., source = "[ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk)".
